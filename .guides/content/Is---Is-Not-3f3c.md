## Comparing with Is

Python uses the keyword `is` for comparison. It replaces `==`.

```python
string1 = "It's Friday!"
string2 = "It's Friday!"
print(string1 is string2)
```

{try it}(python3 code/strings/is-comparison.py 1)

|||challenge
## What happens if you:
* Change `string1` and `string2` to the value `""`?
* Change `string1` to the value `" "`?

{try it}(python3 code/strings/is-comparison.py 2)

## Comparing with Is Not

If `==` can be replaced with `is`, then `!=` can be replaced with `is not`.

```python
string1 = "It's Friday!"
string2 = "It's Monday."
print(string1 is not string2)
```

{try it}(python3 code/strings/is-comparison.py 3)

|||challenge
## What happens if you:
* Change `string1` to `"\""` and change `string2` to `"""`?
* Change `string1` to `"\""` and change `string2` to `'"'`?

  <summary><strong>Why the EOF error?</strong></summary>
  The string <code>"\""</code> is actually a string that looks like this <code>"</code>. But if you put three double quotes in a row, that is starting a multi-line string. Python expects another triple quote to end the multi-line string. Python reached the end of the file (EOF) before finding the triple quote. That is why there is an error.
