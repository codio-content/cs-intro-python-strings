## String Functions

String functions are predefined functions that perform an action on a string. Functions have a specific syntax â€” function name, parentheses, and a string (often a variable) between the parentheses. The string between the parentheses is called a parameter, which is a piece of information the function requires so it can do its job.

In fact, `len` is a string function. There are a few other functions that work with strings.

## The Min Function

The `min` function returns the "smallest" character from a string. Often times this is the character that appears first in alphabetical order. When characters are numbers and symbols, things are not so clear.

```python
my_string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
print(min(my_string))
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `my_string` to `"AaBbCcDd"`?
* Change `my_string` to `"The brown dog jumps over the lazy fox."`?

<details>
  <summary><strong>Note</strong></summary>
  The program does not have an error. You do not see anything because the "smallest" character is the " " between words. You cannot easily see a blank space on its own, which is why it seems like there is a problem with your code.

* Change `my_string` to `"@<#$%!^&*="`?
